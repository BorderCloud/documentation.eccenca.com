# **Snowflake**

## **Introduction**

Eccenca Corporate Memory is a semantic data management platform that allows organizations to store, manage, and interconnect vast amounts of structured and unstructured data.

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing solution that provides a scalable and flexible platform for data storage and analysis. 

The eccenca Corporate Memory platform can connect to Snowflake to take advantage of Snowflakeâ€™s scalability and flexibility for data warehousing solutions. This connection allows organizations to store and manage large amounts of data in Snowflake while using eccenca Corporate Memory to link and interconnect with other data sources, such as databases and cloud applications, to form a comprehensive and unified view of all data assets.

By integrating Snowflake with eccenca Corporate Memory, organizations can achieve a centralized and unified data management system that allows them to gain a complete and accurate view of all their data assets. This integration enables organizations to make informed decisions, improve their business processes, and drive growth and innovation by leveraging their data assets.

- Type the SPARQL query for creating a database in the table that is created, then click on **run**.

       The following is an example of a query for the database.

INSERT INTO product (product_id, product_name, product_manager_name, email, price, height, width, depth, weight) 
VALUES 
(11,'Memristor Encoder','Siglind.Brinkerhoff','Siglind.Brinkerhoff Company.org','3,79 EUR',30,22,19,2).

- Type the JDBC URL path in the **JDBC Driver connection URL** field.

!!! Note
This is a JDBC connection string for connecting to Snowflake data warehouse in eccenca corporate memory.

<!-- Note -> :snowflake: gives an emoji so, using \:snowflake\: for documentation-->

!!! Example 
jdbc\:snowflake\://WTXSZXM-FS77078.snowflakecomputing.com/?db=PRODUCT&schema=PRODUCTS_VOCABULARY.

Here is a breakdown of the elements of this example connection string.

- **jdbc\:snowflake\://** is the prefix for the snowflake JDBC driver.

- **WTXSZXM-FS77078.snowflakecomputing.com** is the URL for the snowflake account you want to connect to. The number **WTXSZXM-FS77078** is the organization number you will get from Snowflake as shown below.

- 
**?db=PRODUCT** specifies the name of the Snowflake database you want to connect to.In this case, the database is named product.

- **&schema=products_vocabulary** specifies the name of the Snowflake schema that you want to use within the specified database. In this case, the schema name is **products_vocabulary**.
