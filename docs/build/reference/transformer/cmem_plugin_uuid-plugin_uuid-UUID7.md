!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This is a [Python Plugin](../../../develop/python-plugins/index.md).
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. [with cmemc](../../../automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/command-reference/admin/workspace/python/index.md).

UUIDv7 features a time-ordered value field derived from the
widely implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source, the
number of milliseconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970 UTC, leap seconds
excluded. As well as improved entropy characteristics over versions
1 or 6.
Implementations SHOULD utilize UUIDv7 over UUIDv1 and
6 if possible.
