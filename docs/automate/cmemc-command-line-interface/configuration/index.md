# Configuration

In order to work with cmemc, you have to configure it according to your needs.


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-file-cog-outline: File-based Configuration

    ---

    The most common way to configure cmemc is with a central [configuration file](file-based-configuration/index.md).

-   :material-cog-outline: Environment-based Configuration

    ---

    In addition to configuration files, cmemc can be widely configured and parameterized with [environment variables](environment-based-configuration/index.md).

-   :material-rocket-launch: Completion Setup

    ---

    Setting up [command completion](completion-setup/index.md) is optional but highly recommended and will greatly speed up your cmemc terminal sessions.

-   :material-key-link: Security Considerations

    ---

    cmemc can be configured to fetch your [credentials from external processes](getting-credentials-from-external-processes/index.md), such as password stores.
    In addition to that, cmemc can work with [custom certificates](certificate-handling-and-ssl-verification/index.md).
