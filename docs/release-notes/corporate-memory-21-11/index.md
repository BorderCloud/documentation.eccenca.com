![21.11 - workflow editor - inline (live) progress and statistics](21-11-Build-Workflow-Live-Data.png "21.11 - workflow editor - inline live progress and statistics")

![21.11. - Explore - custom graph lists as well as new look and feel](21-11-Explore-NewLookAndGraphList.png "21.11. - Explore - custom graph lists as well as new look and feel")

The highlights of this release are:

- Build: The workflow editor user interface allows for undo/redo of you activities now, as well as shows inline (live) progress and statistics of a running workflow.
- Explore: The Explore interface is now adapted to our new look and feel + the Knowledge Graph list component can be configured to show multiple lists of named graphs e.g. to distinguish between user, vocabulary and system graphs.
- Automate: cmemc can now interact with workflow scheduler (disable, enable, inspect, list, open) as well as dataset resources (delete, inspect, usage, list).

- eccenca DataPlatform v21.11.1
- eccenca DataIntegration v21.11
- eccenca DataManager v21.11.5
- eccenca Corporate Memory Control (cmemc) v21.11.4

## eccenca DataIntegration v21.11

This version of eccenca DataIntegration adds the following new features:

- Remote Excel Dataset using Google Drive Spreadsheets as resources.
- Remote Office 365 Spreadsheets Support.
- Workflow editor improvements:
    - View navigation via clicking and dragging the mouse on the mini-map.
    - Config input port is hidden by default and can be enabled via menu entry.
    - Inline (live) progress and statistics.
- Support mapping of RDF literals in object mappings.
    - Literals are handled as entities and can be mapped in object mappings.
    - Special path #text that allows to access the lexical value of the mapped resource. This allows to access the value of a mapped literal in an object mapping.
- RDF datasets:
    - Special path #lang that allows to access the language tag of a language tagged RDF literal.
- Extensions to the Excel dataset:
    - Excel columns may be addressed by their letter code (`#A`, `#B`, etc.) as well.
    - A new parameter 'hasHeader' allows handling of pure data sheets with no table header.
- Support selecting multiple vocabularies with auto-completion support.
- Transform URI pattern improvements:
    - Validation of URI patterns in the UI and backend, i.e. it checks that URI templates generate valid URIs.
    - Auto-completion support in URI pattern input component.
    - URI pattern validation endpoint
    - URI pattern auto-completion endpoint
    - Change initial URI pattern of complex URI rules from `/` to `{}/<OBJECT_RULE_ID>`
- REST endpoint to fetch an activity execution error report as JSON or Markdown.
- Activity integration into task detail pages:
    - Primary, running, failed and all related caching activities are shown on the task detail pages.
    - Caching activities are grouped and have additional information and controls like 'refresh all caches', last update etc.
    - For failed activities it is possible to see and download an execution error report.
- Support for requesting task parameter values in the item search API.
- New workflow operator to stop the current workflow execution (without failing) if a specified condition has been met.
    - Add global cache for URI patterns that stores all URI patterns extracted from transform tasks.
    - Add API endpoint to fetch all URI patterns used for given target class URIs.
    - Allow to select from existing URI patterns (related to the same target classes) in object mapping rule form.
- Support setting the URI pattern during creation of an object mapping rule.

    - The change applies to reading JSON, writing was already streamed.
    - If streaming is enabled, files won't be loaded into memory, allowing to read large JSON files without running into OutOfMemory errors.
- Allow to open the value mapping rule formula editor from the create/edit value mapping rule form.
- Improvements to Template operators:
    - Added option to forward input attributes.
    - Allow tests in conditions (e.g., `if input1 is sequence`).

## eccenca DataPlatform v21.11.2

This version of eccenca DataPlatform ships the following new features:

- Prometheus and Spring metrics endpoints are now exposed per default, i.e. `./actuator/prometheus` or `actuator/metrics` for list and, exemplarily, `./actuator/metrics/cache.size` for the metric of interest, see the [spring doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.metrics.endpoint) for more information.
    - you can deactivate them using the configuration properties in `application.yml` (or any other spring config)
``` yaml title="application.yml"
endpoint:
    prometheus:
        enabled: false
    metrics:
        enabled: false
```
    - Users roles need to match values of `authorization.abox.adminGroup` or `authorization.abox.metricsGroup` role definition for accessing those endpoints. `authorization.abox.metricsGroup` defaults to `metrics`, therefore in keycloak a user needs to `metrics` added as role, for example via a group and groupmapping.
- graphdb lucene index support
    - the index is used for example in the explore section to allow fast and userfriendly access
- Graph List
    - The graph list query is now configurable, using the parameter `proxy.graphListQuery` with a default value of `SELECT distinct ?g {graph ?g {?s ?p ?o}}`

## Migration Notes

### DataIntegration

- The fix of 'XML dataset ignores base path when type URI is set.', could break existing projects that are relying on the previously broken behaviour.
    - This may affect all use cases with XML datasets that have the 'base path' parameter set to a non-empty value AND where a transformation or linking task overwrites this path by setting a type path/URI.
    - Removing the 'base path' value from the affected XML datasets should solve the issue.
- Generating URIs for entities failed if XML tags contained dots
- The JSON dataset uses streaming by default now, which does not support backward paths.
- Using backward paths will fail and the error message will contain a suggestion to change the streaming parameter to false.

### DataManager

No migration notes

### DataPlatform

- Jinja templates will no longer fail on unknown tokens. If this was used for signaling errors or fail-fast evaluation, this has to be implemented in regular conditional checks.
- Virtuoso config requires adjustments, its HTTP port needs to be configured.
    - Please ensure, that the configured user has the same access rights in virtuoso via ODBC and HTTP
``` yaml title="application.yml (old)"
sparqlEndpoints:
  virtuoso:
  - id: "default"
    authorization: NONE
    host: "store"
    port: "1111"
    username: "dba"
    password: "dba"
```
