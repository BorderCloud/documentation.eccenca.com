The highlights of this release are:

- Explore: The new Data Manager vocabulary viewer visualises classes and its relations (subclasses, domain/range relations) from an installed vocabulary.
- Automate: cmemc is now able to fetch credentials from external processes in order to integrate with company wide or personal password infrastructure.
