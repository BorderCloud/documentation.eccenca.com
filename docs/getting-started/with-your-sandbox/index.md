!!! info inline end ""

    ![Your are here](overview-cmem.drawio.svg "You are here")

## Introduction

eccenca Corporate Memory is an Enterprise Knowledge Graph creation and management platform. The platform has three main functional stages: _Build_, _Explore_, and _Consume_. The _Build_ stage is used to turn your legacy data points from existing datasets into an Enterprise Knowledge Graph structure. The _Explore_ stage allows you to interact with your Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Lastly the _Consume_ stage is about retrieve information from the Knowledge Graph and to have programmatic integrations points with your BI, analytics, reporting, process or other IT layers.

    ---

    The sandbox includes a sample build project named _"Product Data Integration Demo"_ and graphs that create a Knowledge Graph for the product domain (accessible through _"Products - Integration"_ as the entry point). Shapes are provided for the Product Vocabulary. The EasyNav module allows for visual exploration based on these shapes. Additionally, a customized workspace configuration called _"Product Data Integration"_ demonstrates how the user interface can be tailored for specific purposes.

    ---

    _BUILD_ data product pipelines that turn you existing data points into Enterprise Knowledge Graphs. Use them to establish data product assembly lines in a visual intuitive and business user compatible fashion.
